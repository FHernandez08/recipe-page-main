# My Process
Built with:
  - HTML
  - CSS: Grid and Flex Properties

For the HTML, I realized that I would need to create different sections for each major component of this project, starting from the ingredients down to the nutrition section.

For the CSS, I worked on incorporating both flex and grid. I first incorporated flex properties on the list items to create the larger gap that was seen in the preview image on the project. I later used grid in the nutrtion section, by creating a grid class with grid-items to have all elements aligned properly and evenly as shown in the screenshots.

** I later realized that I calculated the height wrong as I was going based off the design images shown on the project, to fully see the screenshots, head into inspect, and change the dimensions to:
      - 1440 x 1955
      - 375 x 2043

# What I Learned
I learned how to implement both grid and flex properties inside the container to be able to learn how to implement both. I was able to gain more confidence in using grid, as it used to be a weak point of mines when I worked with grid.

# Continued development
For this section, I believe that I just need more practice doing projects like these. These projects has helped me become more efficient using these two languages.
My goal would be able to incorporate JavaScript and React, and later on Node.js into these projects to fully make these projects actual websites.
